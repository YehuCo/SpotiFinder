**Problem:** 
When trying to remember songs, many people remember only a phrase from the song title, or even just a word. Knowing only a few words, it is difficult to then look for the whole song name, since looking up a word or two will result in a search result that is filled with every website or video that contains that word. We are trying to solve this problem by creating a specific program that searches exclusively through song names, and returns a list of song names that contain the specific inputted word. 

**Motivation:**
We as a group have experienced many times the inconvenience of not remembering a song title we like in its entirety. We also know that this is a simple inconvenience that our friends and peers have faced, and so we want to make something practical that will address this issue.

**Features:**
The user can get a list of song titles containing the inputted search word up to a determined amount by the user. The returned list will be ordered by popularity of each song, with the most popular song being the first song in the list. To evaluate sorting efficiency, the user will be able to decide which algorithm they would like to use to sort the list. 

**Data:**
The data used in this project is made up of 112,000 unique songs, along with each songâ€™s popularity. The csv format has the song popularity in the first column, followed by song name, to make reading the csv file into the program simpler. 

**Tools:**
The tools used for this project were C++, which was used to write the program, Excel, which was used to tailor the data to our needs and hold the data, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
